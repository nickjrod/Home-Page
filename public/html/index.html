				About
				</h2>
				<p>
					Hello, my name is Nicholas Rodriguez. I am orginally from San Antonio, Texas. Recently, I have begun my dive into web technologies and started to appreciate beautiful, functional design. So much so, that I have decided to pivot my career and pursue it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I went to UC Berkeley and studied EECS (Electrical Engineering & Computer Science). I love the Bay Area and Berkeley and will find my way back over there soon. Can't beat the incredible food, weather, and surrounding natural beauty.
				</p>
				<p>
					For pleasure, I enjoy boxing, cooking and learning new recipes, and raising potted plants. Boxing, oddly enough, has a therapeutic effect on me. The rocking back and forth interrupted with quick, violent bursts of energy helps me decompress and release. I love boxing. As far as cooking, my father has been the big inspiration. His love shines through his cooking. Memories of my dad grilling or around the kitchen immediately come to my mind when I think of him. Cooking is a voiceless expression with endless possibilities and one of the only areas in my life where I feel the same satisfaction from consuming the exact same thing over and over. The gift that doesn't stop giving. Lastly, I love looking at and growing potted plants. I can't help but feel like that elementary school scienctist tweaking all the growing variables: water, light, soil, and fertilizer. This constant balancing of variables along with the patience needed to wait and see the effects leads to a beautiful plant definitely worth the wait!
